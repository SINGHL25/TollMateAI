# ✅ HOW TO RUN

1. Install Flutter SDK: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. `cd android_app_flutter/webview`
3. `flutter pub get`
4. Connect your Android device or use emulator
5. `flutter run`

✅ It will load your Streamlit app URL inside native Android container.

🛠️ In future, replace `'http://your-streamlit-ip:8501'` with deployed URL (like Railway, Render, or EC2 public IP).
